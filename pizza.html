    <h1>Pizza</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <body>
    Pizza is a vareity of savoury pie originating from Naples, Italy, to the early 19th century. A pizza usually is comprised of a flat, bread-base, and topped with a tomato-based or white-wine based sauce, topped off with cheese and toppings.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <body>
    Pizza is one of several food items that compose of a flat bread with meat, vegetables, and cheese being toppings of it. Similar dishes include Gozleme, a turkish street dish that often uses Flatbread, Spinach, and various different kinds of cheese, often Feta and Lava≈ü. Several cultures have made similar dishes of bread, cheese, and toppings, and pizza developed out of similar dishes in the region of naples. 
        
    
    The Inventor of modern pizza is sometimes attributed to Raffaele Esposito, who is said to have invented the original Margherita, for the Italian royal family. Queen Margherita is said to have requested a Pizza with the Italian Tricolour, red, white, and green. Esposito's Pizzeria, now known as Pizzeria Brandi, is still open to this day. 
        
    Italian migration to the United States eventually led to the establishment of several pizzerias across the United States, starting with Lombardi's in New York City, 1905. Various Styles of styles of pizza began to emerge in the years following the second world war, principly, The New York Slice, Chicago Pie, Newhaven Style, Detroit style, and St. Louis style, alongside the original Neopolitan style from Italy. 
        
    In 2009, Neopolitan-Style Pizza became a protected designation of origin dish.

    <h2>Styles</h2>
    <body>
    Pizza has developed various styles over the years, especially in the United States. All pizza styles have a few common attributes:
    </body>
    <body>1. A pizza pizza is composed of bread base and has cheese and toppings</body>
    <body>2. Any pizza is baked in some manner</body>
    <body>3. Any style can use any toppings</body>
    <h3>Neopolitan</h3>
    <body> Neopolitan Pizza is the origin of the dish. The base is made of dough from high quality bread flour, often a "00" type. The style uses a tomato-based sauce often, usually San Marzano tomatoes, a cultivar grown in the Naples region that is highly acclaimed for its use and taste in sauce. The cheese is usually Fresh Mozzarella, which is either cut or pulled apart, and placed on the pizza. Parmesan cheese is often used as well. The pizza is cooked in a wood-fired oven, which gives it a slightly charred flavour and appearance. When cooked, the pie has a thick, airy, crust, and a flat, thin base, which has the sauce, cheese, and other toppings and garnishes. The pizza has less cheese than would be normal of most other pies, but usually is compensated with the flavour of the sauce and other toppings, alongside the crust. The pizza should not gennerally be difficult to cut.

    <h3>New york style</h3>
    <body>New york style pizza originates to Gennaro Lombardi in 1905. The pizza's base, like neopolitan, is also usually a high quality bread flour, often with sugar and oil. The sauce also often will use San Marzano, although it is different from Neopolitan in that it adds sugar to the sauce, which isnt usally present in neopolitan style sauces. Herbs such as oregano and basil may be added to the sauce, alongside tomato paste. New york style pizza will also often have parmesan placed on the base, with dried Mozzarella and toppings on the top. Traditionally, New york Style pizza is baked in a coal-fired oven, and will should not have any noticeable char. When cooked, the crust will be browned, thin, and slightly crunchy, and should not be much thicker than the base will be well-browned and thin.The cheese should stretch noticeably when hot, and the sauce should have an intense, saturated flavour. A New York pie can be quite large, up to a meter in diameter. It is often sold by the slice
    </body>
    <h3>Chicago Style</h3>
   <body>Chicago style first emerged in the 1940's with Uno's pizzeria, although some reports show that the style emerged earlier. Chicago style is quite unorthodox for a pizza, it resembles a typical pie much more than other styles, and has a unqiue preparation. The Dough and sauce is not terribly different than that of Naples, however the preparation is drastically different. The dough is prepared in an oiled baking pan, similar to that of a pie, with the base taking an overall bowl shape, and cheese, usually mozzarella, alongside toppings goes on the bottom first, instead of sauce, which comes second. The pizza is baked for 30 minutes, which is much longer than the typical pizza, and once cooked, should have a thick, high crust, with the cheese being stretchy. 
    </body> 
    <h3>Detroit style</h3>
    <body>Detroit style is derived from Sicilian pizza, which is square, and baked like a focaccia. The style originates from Buddy's Pizza, a former speak-easy in Detroit, Michigan. The style only recently became popular outside of Detroit. The Pizza's dough is similar to that of focaccia and its sauce is similar to New York style. The cheese used is a variety of American Cheddar from Wisconsin known as Brick cheese. The Pizza traditionally is baked in a oil drip tray, although regular baking trays are gennerally used. This gives the Pizza its trademark rectangualar shape. Similar to chicago style pizza, the cheese is placed on the base before the sauce. The sauce is placed on top of the cheese in lines across the pan, it should not cover the entire pie. Toppings are placed after the sauce however, and in much greater amounts than would be typical of other styles. Once baked, the pie should have a thick, flat, base, with very little difference in thickness between the crust and the rest of the pie, with a small amount of char.</body>
    <h3>Sicilian style</h3>
    <body>Siciliian Pizza orginates from the island of Sicily, Italy. Sicillian usually has a thick, square base, although can resemble Neopolitan. There is usually more sauce, cheese, and herbs. The cheese used is often caciocavallo. The pie, when baked should have large amounts of melted cheese, a little char, and a thick base.</body>
    <h3>New Haven style</h3>
    <body>This little-known, but distinct style, originates from the town of New Haven, Conneticut. The pizza is closely related to New york style, but has some key charachteristics which make it distinct. The dough, like New york style, is made with high quality bread flour, with less protein than New york style. Cheese used is commonly a small amount of Pecorino Romano, although mozzarella can be added on request. The pizza is baked in a coal-fired oven for longer than new york style, leading to a thin, crispy crust, with a moderate amount of char. The pizza is usually served with uneven slices.</body>
