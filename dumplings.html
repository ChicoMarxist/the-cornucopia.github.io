<h1>Dumplings</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Dumplings are a broad class of pastry that consist of pastry with filling or no filling. Dumplings can be served as a stand-alone dish, an hoeur d'oeuvre, or as a an accompanyment in soup. Dumplings have emerged in almost every culture, perhaps most distinctly in East Asian cuisine. Traditionally, dumplings are often eaten as a part of local festivites, most often the coming of the New Year. DUmplings are often staples of their local cusine.</p> 

<h2>Types</h2>
<p>Dumplings can be either dough that has filling, or are just pieces of dough. In either case, the dumplings can either be sweet or savoury. The dough in dumplings is usaully based either on bread, flour, or potato. Dumplings can be cooked by almost any preperation method.</p>
<h3>Filled Dumplings</h3>
<p>Filled Dumplings are gennerally the first thing people think about dumplings. Such dumplings are usually filled with a combination of meat, cheese, and vegetables, wrapped in pastry, usually with a flour-base. Examples of this can include Japan's pork-filled Gyoza, Nepal's chicken-filled Momos, or Italy's cheese-filled Ravioli, amongst many others.</p>
<h3>Dough-dumplings</h3>
<p>Dough Dumplings, or bread dumplings, are dumplings that purely consist of dough. Such dumplings are less prevalent, although they still are heavily used in many cultures. Examples include Judaism's Kneidelach(Matzah balls), Italy's Gnocchi, or South African Dombolo.</p>

<h2>Serving</h2>
<p>Dumplings are gennerally served according to the type of dumpling and local culture. East Asian Cultures have gennerally served dumplings as stand-alone or side dishes, although there is an abundance of examples of them being served in other meals, such as Chinese Wantons. As a stand alone dish, dumplings are gennerally fried, baked, or steamed. In european cuisine, Dumplings are also often boiled. Dumplings that are served in soup are nearly consistently boiled, often in the broth itself, especially bread dumplings.</p>
<p>As a stand alone dish, dumplings are often served with a sauce or condiment, sometimes having been placed on the dumplings prior to serving. When served in soup, a garnish of vegetables may be present, which will vary between cultures. In most cases, dumplings are typically served in amounts between five and ten, although in cases such as gnocchi and ravioli, this number is much higher, usually a minimum of fifteen.</p>
