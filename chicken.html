    <h1>Chicken</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Chickens are a vareity of birds that claim descent from the Red Junglefowl. Chickens have been living with humans for millenia, largely thanks to their breeding speed and cheap cost of raising. Chickens were initially raised for cockfighting, then for their eggs, and then their meat. Chickens are today the most commonly eaten poultry.</p>
    
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <p>Chicken has a vareity of preparation methods, which usually relate to the meat, or a byproduct of the cooking process. The bird can be cooked whole, spatchcocked, minced, cut into various pieces, which is done via frying, boiling, baking, or roasting.</p>
    <h3>Cuts</h3>
    <p>Chickens typically have four major cuts: Legs, Wings, Breasts, and Thighs. Other cuts, such as the Neck and back are also sometimes used, but are quite rarely sold. Tenderloins are also sometimes sold as a seperate cut of the bird.</p>
    <p>Breasts are the leanest cut of the bird, and can be used in a vareity of ways cut or served whole. Breasts are the most common portion used in made whole in Schnitzel, Chicken Katsu, and other types of large, breaded chicken. Breast can also be cut into strips, which are henceforth referred to as tenders, and then used in stir-frys, or simply cooked outright, and then stored for other uses.</p>
    <p>Legs, or Drumsticks, are the legs of the bird with a sizable amount of meat, having a pone run down the middle. When served alone, Legs can be cooked in many similar ways to that of a whole chicken. Legs are often served Baked, Roasted, or fried, and are often heavily seasoned, often with paprika.</p>
    <p>Wings are the smallest major cut of the bird, and are usually served fried as an appetiser with seasoning similarly to drumsticks, though this is not always the case. Buffalo wings are a famous serving method.</p>
    <p>Thighs are generally the fattiest portion of the bird, and are used in a similar variety of ways to breast, although the thighs are smaller.</p>
    
    <h2>Byproducts</h2>
    <p>Many parts of the process of producing chicken, or cooking chicken, can leave byproducts. Such byproducts are often local delicacies in various cultures.</p>
    <h3>Skin</h3>
    <p>Skin is often discarded in factory manuafacturing, but is often present in whole chickens. The skin is high in fat, and is usually regarded as unhealthy. The skin is essentially in the rendering of chicken fat, also known as shmaltz, which in turn leaves gribenes, or chicken cracklings. Both are staples in Ashekenazic Jewish cusine. The cracklings and fat are oftened seasoned with fried onion.</p>
    <h3>Feet</h3>
    <p>Chicken feet are often discarded from the bird, however in many cuisines, they are commonplace, and are usually fried and steamed.</p>

    <h3>Head and neck</h3>
    <p>The head and neck of the bird are often discarded, however, they are often eaten in east asian cuisine.</p>
    
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>Chicken is used in a diverse number of dishes and preperation, more than any other kind of poultry. When whole, a chicken is often roasted or baked, usually with a garnish of herbs or marinade. In a bizarre case of double engastration, Turducken has a deboned, whole, chicken, stuffed into a deboned, whole, duck, which is further stuffed inside a whole, deboned, Turkey. A whole chicken is also often boiled to make stock. The chicken in all cases, should not be dry. 
    
    Chicken is also regularly minced. Minced chicken is commonly used in dishes that are used to make rissoles, dumplings, or simply an alternate to ground beef in many cases. Fried chicken is often used as a comfort food, which rarely comprises the entire bird, but uses cuts of the chicken, usually the breast, wing, or leg, before then breading it, before frying and serving.</p>
